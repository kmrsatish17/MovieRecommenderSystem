1) Transfer the file to the server:
pscp cosine.py movies.csv ratings.csv kkhuran1@dsba-hadoop.uncc.edu:/users/kkhuran1/

2) Create a folder in Hadoop and move the files
hadoop fs -put ratings.csv /user/kkhuran1/input
hadoop fs -put movies.csv /user/kkhuran1/input

3) Spark program for movie recommendation and its required arguments
spark-submit cosine.py /user/kkhuran1/input/ratings.csv   /user/kkhuran1/input/movies.csv > movies_final.out

4) cat the file files to check the results
cat movies_final.out

5) Transfer the files to local folder
pscp kkhuran1@dsba-hadoop.uncc.edu:/users/kkhuran1/movies_final.out "E:\"
